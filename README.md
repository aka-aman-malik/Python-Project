# Python-Project
Before visualizing the data, I conducted a deep-dive technical analysis to ensure data integrity and accuracy. This phase focused on transforming a raw, messy dataset of customer information into a structured format suitable for high-level business intelligence.
# Technical Workflow
Data Cleaning: Used Pandas and NumPy to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct inconsistent data types across thousands of records.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed statistical analysis to identify correlations between customer demographics and purchase amounts.

Outlier Detection: Implemented logic to find and address anomalies in the "Average Purchase Amount" and "Review Ratings" to prevent skewed results.

Feature Engineering: Created new derived columns (such as Age Groups and Subscription Tiers) to enable more granular insights in the final dashboard.

# The Outcome
The result was a 100% clean and optimized dataset that served as the foundation for my SQL querying and Power BI visualization, ensuring that every business insight was based on verified data.
